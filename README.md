👩‍💻 Back-End SQL Database 👩‍💻
</h1>

<p align="center">  
It is based off a dog daycare, there are 2 tables to establish a one to many relationship between them; Dogs, Owners and in this database you can assign an Owner to a Dog with a few error handles. 
I created a database in ElephantSQL and created an API incorporating it into request handles, this uses various HTTP methods (GET, DELETE, POST & PATCH) to interact with the SQL database, the HTTP methods have also been tested, to ensure they work as intended.
This has been built following the Model View Controller Pattern & Express Server router.

## 🏫 Lessons Learned

<p align="center">
- Understanding MVC architecture, what it is, how to implement and creating this project I can see the benefit of this structure for a developer.
- Error handling, it's been a good introduction into how handle errors, what checks you can put to ensure requests are being handled correctly and the appropriate response for when there is an error. <br>
- Using Express and how it's used to run a server. <br>
- Familiarising myself with the process of API requests, how to send an object over and how to handle server crashes.
- Testing, knowledge of how to structure tests, what assertions to make and improved understanding of how my server works and runs!
</p>

## 💭 Reflections
<p align="center">
What went well? <br>
This is my first server build, itself running able to perform CRUD functions is a success itself.
The MVC structure is working very well and it really helped break down the steps of performing API requests.
</p>

<p align="center">
What could be improved? <br>
Exploring error handling further, you could implement more middleware or packages for error handling.
There is the opportunity to create a front end!
