Hello! I'll be creating a database and creating an API incorporating it into request handles. I will attempt to use various HTTP methods to interact with the SQL database.

This will be extending from a bootcamp hackthon, this time following a MVC Pattern & Express Router. This will use Node.js, Express.js, Postgres and JS.

It is based off a dog daycare, there are 2 tables to establish a one to many relationship between them; Dogs, Owners and in this database you can assign an Owner to a Dog with a few error handles.

To my knowledge now, you won't be able to interact with it yourself (unless you too use ElephantSQL, and in the .env file follow the same variables as mine but your own URL and PORT). But with GitHub, you'll at least be able to see the code!
