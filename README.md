Hello! I'll be creating a database and creating an API incorporating it into request handles. I will attempt to use various HTTP methods to interact with the SQL datrabase.

This will be created from scratch following a MVC Pattern & Express Router. This will use Node.js, Express.js, Postgres and JS.

To my knowledge now, you won't be able to interact with it yourself (unless you too use ElephantSQL, and in the .env file follow the same variables as mine but your own URL and PORT). But with GitHub, you'll at least be able to see the code!
